# Matcha
*Matcha* is a customable little program for mosaic creation.

Take a folder of images and some target photo, *Matcha* will compose your final result using the available tiles. It can work with or without replacement of the used tiles, depending on whether the quantity of the tiles is limited. You can also specify how to match the tiles, defining your own similarity function.
