# Matcha
Until yesterday, *Matcha* was two things: a variety of tea, and the wrong spelling of the word "matcher".
Today, *Matcha* is also a third thing: a simple program for mosaic creation.

Take a folder of images and some target photo, *Matcha* will compose your final result using the available tiles. It can work with or without replacement of the used tiles, depending on whether the quantity of the tiles is limited.
